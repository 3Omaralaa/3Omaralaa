    Before that, I designed for GitHub for 6+ years.
    <br>It was here where I grew up, developed my opinions,
    <br>and became a GitHub maxi.

  <summary><b>:telescope: 2023 goal</b></summary>
  I've become deeply committed to <a href="https://www.optimism.io/vision">Optimism's vision</a> of the decentralized future. My most important goal this year is to grow the design function at OP Labs such that I'm the worst designer on the team. Building this design team will be my ongoing contribution in supporting Optimism's progress on solving gnarly problems like public goods funding, identity, and contribution in web3.

  <summary><b>:cyclone: 2022 goal</b></summary>
   My 2022 goal was to start learning and designing for governance in web3. This is still an ongoing journey, but I've made some progress through my time at OP Labs :relieved:

  âœ¨ <strong><a href="https://prettygood.club/">I DID IT!</a></strong> âœ¨ I <i>finally</i> focused on a body of work in pottery. I'm damn proud. Going to keep it up, but slowly. :)<br><br>
  <i>I didn't complete my 2020 goal, but it was a crazy different year ðŸ˜‚ In 2021, I want to finally have a portfolio site and make an online storefront for my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/prettygoodclub/" target="_blank">pottery</a>. Here's to new aspirations and forgiving yourself for not finishing every goal you set for yourself for the new year.</i>

  I want to make a little game this year.<br>I'm currently working on a small gameboy game with <a href="https://github.com/tfgrimes">@tfgrimes</a> using <a href="https://github.com/chrismaltby/gb-studio" target="_blank">GBStudio.dev</a>, which is an awesome game creator tool that makes it really easy to design a game if you're primarily focusing on the art and story (like myself). I'm hoping to print this on a cartridge when I'm done so you can actually experience it on a Gameboy!
